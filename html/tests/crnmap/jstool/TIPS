_coding tips_

One function must do one thing. Write a new function if you want to extend the functionality. This will spare you time in 
the end. Redesign if need be.

Make it work. Make it correct. Make it cheaper/faster. In this order.


_javascript + ecmascript pitfalls (here be dragons)_

Watch out for potential closure leaks.

'this' is a weird animal. Watch out if used inside an event handler.

Avoid MSIE's addevent. Play safely.

DO NOT RELY ON THE LANGUAGE FEATURE TO END YOUR CODE SENTENCES!
ALWAYS FINISH WITH A SEMI-COLON!!!!!

_coding style_

function not_anonymous ()
{
	/// this is a comment left for another programmer (human or alien)
	// var code_commented_out = function () { alert (1); };
}

var fn = function ()
{
	/// write anonymous functions like this
	// not_anonymous();
}

If one has the screen real estate do this:
function fn ()
{
	/// ...
Not this:
function fn () {
	/// ...

The latter style was used in printed books to save on space, pages and trees.
If you're not working on a fibrous medium, why would you be so stingy with space?
