CRN Station Data

[description]
This example shows five weather variables from the Climate
Reference Network weather station at the North Carolina Arboretum in
Asheville, NC.  It combines multiple plot styles in a single graph,
using several parallel vertical axes.  It uses a REST web service to
pull real data from NOAA's National Climatic Data Center.
