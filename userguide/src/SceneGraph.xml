<title>The Flex Scene Graph</title>

<para>
Multigraph uses a heirarchy of Flex objects to construct its graph.  If you are
working with the Multigraph source code it can be helpful to understand this
heirarchy.  (This information is only needed if you are working with the Multigraph
source code.)
</para>

<para>
Each graph in Multigraph consists of an instance of the Graph class, which
extends the Flex class <code>mx.core.UIComponent</code> and
is implemented in the source file <code>Graph.as</code>.  Each Graph object
defines the nested heirarchy of UIComponent objects depicted in
<xref linkend="figSceneGraph"/>.  This documentation will eventually contain
more detail about this SceneGraph.
