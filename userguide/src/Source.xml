<title>Working with the Multigraph Source Code</title>

<para>
Multigraph is an open source project.  Anyone is welcome to download
the source code and modify it.  You can download the source code
from
<ulink url="http://www.multigraph.org/download">http://www.multigraph.org/download</ulink>.
</para>

<para>
Multigraph is written in ActionScript, which is the language of the
Adobe Flash player.  The Multigraph source code is organized as a
project for the Flex Builder Eclipse
(<ulink url="http://www.eclipse.org">http://www.eclipse.org</ulink>)
plugin from Adobe, which is available from
<ulink url="http://www.adobe.com/products/flex">http://www.adobe.com/products/flex</ulink>.
The
Multigraph source code zip file includes the Eclipse project files, so
importing the project into your copy of Eclipse should be
straightforward.
The Flex Builder plugin is unfortunately not free, but you can download a free 60-day trial version
from the above web page.  Also, it IS free for use in academic institutions
(<ulink url="https://freeriatools.adobe.com/flex">https://freeriatools.adobe.com/flex</ulink>),
and there is an alpha version for Linux that is free to anyone
(<ulink url="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/flex/flexbuilder_linux">http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/flex/flexbuilder_linux</ulink>).

In addition to Flex Builder, it is also possible to compile Multigraph with Adobe's
free SDK compiler, which is available from 
<ulink url="http://www.adobe.com/products/flex/flexdownloads/index.html">http://www.adobe.com/products/flex/flexdownloads/index.html</ulink>.  If you are going to do much work with the Multigraph source code, though,
you will probably want to get Flex Builder.
