<title>Constant Lines</title>

<para>
Sometimes it is helpful to add a horizontal line to a graph that appear at a certain place
along the axes but that doesn't correspond to a variable in your data.  For example, on a temperature plot
you might want to draw a horizontal line that indicates a freezing point.  You can do this 
by creating a separate <sgmltag>plot</sgmltag> element for the line, and using the
<sgmltag>constant</sgmltag> element inside the plot's
<sgmltag>verticalaxis</sgmltag> element, instead of the
<sgmltag>variable</sgmltag> element.  The <sgmltag>constant</sgmltag> element takes one attribute,
<sgmltag>value</sgmltag>, which is the data value at which the horizontal line should appear.
You can specify styling details for the horizontal line, such as what plot style and colors to use,
in the normal way for all plots as described in <xref linkend="Plots"/>, by using the
<sgmltag>renderer</sgmltag> subelement.
