current axis attributes:
   min,max
   position: offset of the axis, in pixels, relative to bottom (for horiz axes) or left (for vertical) edge of plot box
   positionbase: if "right", change meaning of "position" attribute to be relative to right rather than left edge of plot box
                 if "top", change meaning of "position" attribute to be relative to top rather than bottom edge of plot box
   minoffset,maxoffset: pixel amounts
   pregap,postgap: pixel amounts
   position

new axis attributes:
   min,max: same as before
   minposition,maxposition: location of min/max point along axis, as expression of the form 'A[oN]', where A
   							is a number from -1 to 1, o is '+' or '-', and N is a nonnegative integer indicating
							a number of pixels.
   anchor = location rel to axis length ([-1,1]) of anchor point
   base = point rel to plot box ([-1,1] X [-1,1]) where anchor is attached
   position = pixel offset as coord pair or single number; if single number, defaults to displacement in perp direction,
              for consistency with old meaning of "position"
   length = AoN, where A = fraction of plot box dimension, N = pixel offset







new axis attributes:

   minoffset,maxoffset: deprecated
   pregap,postgap: deprecated
   positionbase: deprecated
   base: plot box relative coordinates [(-1,-1) to (1,1)] of base point where axis is attached
   anchor: axis-relative coordinate [-1 to 1] of point on axis where attached to base point
   position: pixel offset amounts; accepts a coordinate pair of pixels, but if just one number is specified, defaults
             to using that number as the vertical coordinate for horizontal axes, or the horizontal coordinate for
             vertical axes.  For example, position="5" is the same as position="0 5" for a horizontal axis, or
	     position="5 0" for a vertical axis.  This gives consistency with the old (original) meaning of
	     the position attribute.
   minpos,maxpos: expression of the form "AoNp" where A = axis length fraction, o = "+" or "-", N = pixel displacement, p = "p"
      Examples:
                maxpos="1-5p": max position is at far end of axis, minus 5 pixels
                maxpos="0+5p": max position is at near end of axis, plus 5 pixels
                maxpos="0": max position is at near end of axis (plus 0 pixels)
      so old style minoffset="S" is same as minpos="0+Sp"
               and maxoffset="T" is same as maxpos="1-Tp"
   offset,length: expression of the form "AoNp", similar to above, where A = plotbox length/width fraction, N = pixel displacement,
               "offset" gives position of "near" end of axis, and "length" gives axis length.
               Default is offset="0+0p", length="1+0p".
               old style pregap="S", postgap="T" are same as offset="0+Sp", length="1-Up", where U=T+S.

*** check for consistency in use of the terms "position", "base", "offset", etc. with attributes associated with other MUGL tags.
